✅ Final Dataset Selection for Tourism Model

Source: The cleaned + preprocessed tourism dataset we built (after handling missing values, normalizing, encoding, and dropping duplicates).

Target Variable (Y): Depends on your app’s use case, e.g.:

Tourist arrivals (forecasting)

Tourism spend (prediction)

User preference (recommendation)

Features (X):

Demographics – age group, nationality, traveler type (solo, family, business).

Location Data – destination, region, attractions visited.

Seasonality – month, season, weather conditions.

Travel Attributes – duration of stay, accommodation type, transport mode.

Cost & Spend – average spend per trip, package price.

Engagement – reviews, ratings, repeat visits (if available).

Exclusions: Removed irrelevant IDs, highly correlated features (like “state_code” vs “state_name”), free-text columns that aren’t useful without NLP.
