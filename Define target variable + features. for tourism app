🎯 Target Variable (Y)

This depends on what the ML model is designed to do in your tourism app. Common options:

Tourist Arrival Forecasting →

Target: num_tourists (number of tourists visiting a location/period).

Tourism Spend Prediction →

Target: avg_spend (average spend per tourist/trip).

Recommendation System (personalized trips) →

Target: tourist_preference (rating/choice of destination or activity).

👉 For a general tourism app, the most practical target variable is:
tourist_count (number of tourists visiting a destination in a given time).
